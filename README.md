# LaTeX Template for writing a Thesis

This is a template that can be used for writing a thesis. It specializes on students working at a company and doing a
project there where they need to write a thesis for.

## Usage

- `Variables.tex`: configure data like your name and title of the thesis
- `Preamble/Coding.tex`: add custom keywords to the language of your choice
- `Structure/`: structures the document; file names should be self-explanatory
- `Text/`: this is where your text goes
- `Assets/`: images, code, ...

## Build

There a build scripts for both Windows and Linux/macOS in `.vscode`. The `launch.json` contains a configuration for
Windows (PowerShell), but not for Linux/macOS (Shell) because I don't know how to to that.
